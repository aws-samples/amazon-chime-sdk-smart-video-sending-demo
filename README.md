## About

This demo showcases how to use the Amazon Chime SDK to show 16 video attendees when more than 16 attendees have enabled videos. It allows the attendee who enables local video most recently to share video to the meeting attendees.

## To run the app locally:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`

2. Start the webpack server and the node server concurrently: `npm run start`

3. Open https://0.0.0.0:9000/ in your browser

## To deploy the serverless device demo

### Install aws and sam command line tools

- [Install the AWS CLI version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- [Install the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

### Run deployment script

The following will create a CloudFormation stack containing a Lambda and
API Gateway deployment that runs the demo.

```
cd serverless
node ./deploy.js -r us-east-1 -b <YOUR-S3-BUCKET-NAME> -s <YOUR-CLOUDFORMATION-STACK-NAME>
```

The script will create an S3 bucket and CloudFormation stack
with Lambda and API Gateway resources required to run the demo. After the script
finishes, it will output a URL that can be opened in a browser.

### Clean up

To remove all the resources from this project, simply delete the CloudFormation stack.
